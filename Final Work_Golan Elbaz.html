            </strong>
            <p>Tesla Motors was founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.
                The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. The next three
                employees were Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel, all of whom are retroactively allowed to
                call
                themselves co-founders of the company.
                Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current CEO, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors
                as a
                technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices
                affordable to the average consumer.
                In February 2017, Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla.
                After 11 years in the market, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in as well as
                best-selling
                battery electric passenger car manufacturer by cars sold in 2019, both as a brand and by automotive
                group, with a market share of 17% of the plug-in segment and 23% of the battery electric segment.
                Tesla global vehicle sales increased 50% from 245,240 units in 2018 to 367,849 units in 2019.
                On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car.
                As of March 2020, the Model 3 ranks as the world's all-time best-selling plug-in electric car, with
                more
                than 500,000 delivered.
                Tesla has never had a profitable year however, it has had several individually profitable quarters,
                most
                recently the quarters ending September 2018, December 2018, September 2019, December 2019, and March
                2020.

                On February 20, 2020, Tesla reached a market capitalization of US$166 billion.

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px; text-decoration: underline">Tesla Cybertruck</h1>
            </strong>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong>
                The Tesla Cybertruck looks like it was dropped off by an alien race, but it has the capabilities to
                challenge all of the top-selling pickup trucks.
                With a sharp-edged exterior that is made of scratch- and dent-resistant stainless steel, Tesla's
                all-electric truck is seriously tough. Along with available all-wheel drive, the Cybertruck can tow
                up
                to 14,000 pounds and has an estimated driving range of 500-plus miles.
                While that applies only to the most expensive model, the cheapest one starts at $39,900. Of course,
                there's still a lot we don't know about the Cybertruck, including when it will officially go on
                sale.
                Right now, it looks as if the first versions will go into production in late 2021</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Pricing and Which One to Buy</strong>
                Single Motor: $39,900
                Dual Motor: $49,900
                Tri Motor: $69,900
                The Cybertruck will be available in three different configurations, which are all based on the
                number of
                electric motors each has. While all-wheel drive is standard on all but the single-motor version,
                each
                additional motor means quicker acceleration, longer driving range, and greater towing capacity.

                <strong> Engine, Transmission, and Performance</strong>

                The Cybertruck is available with not just one, not just two, but three electric motors. While the
                single-motor truck has rear-wheel drive, the two- and three-motor models have all-wheel drive. Tesla
                claims it'll go from zero to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds and top out at 110 mph.
                The dual-motor Cybertruck will reportedly reach 60 mph in just 4.5 ticks and have a top speed of 120
                mph. Those looking for the ultimate performance will appreciate the three-motor model, which Tesla
                says
                will essentially teleport from zero to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds (!) with a top speed of 130 mph. All
                Cybertrucks have an adjustable air suspension that can be raised or lowered on the fly and provides
                up
                to 16 inches of ground clearance.
                Add that to its 35-degree approach and 28-degree departure angles and the Tesla pickup could prove
                to be
                a formidable off-road machine</p>

            </strong>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong>
                Although originally intended to be an electric car for the masses, the 2019 Tesla Model 3 is instead
                more of an all-electric alternative to compact luxury sedans. The promised $35,000 Model 3 is now
                available only by special order, meaning the least expensive version available to order online
                starts at
                $41,100â€”in the territory of the BMW 3-series and the Mercedes-Benz C-class.
                The Model 3's available driving range starts at 240 miles for the base Standard Range Plus Battery
                model
                and goes up to 310 for the Long Range Battery model.</p>

            </strong>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong>
                The newest ambitious project from Tesla is the all-electric Model Y compact crossover. Tesla founder
                and
                CEO Elon Musk touted a driving range of up to 300 miles and a zero-to-60-mph time of as low as 3.5
                seconds when he unveiled the Model Y during a livestreamed event in March 2019.
                The 2020 Tesla Model Y looks very similar to the compact Model 3 sedan, but can be outfitted with a
                third row of seats for a total seating capacity of seven.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Pricing and Which One to Buy</strong>
                Standard Range: $40,200
                Long Range: $49,200
                Performance: $62,200
                Buying an electric car is all about the range, so we'd suggest sticking with the Long Range model
                since
                the Standard Range and Performance variants can't travel quite as far between charges. We'll know
                more
                about the Model Y's standard and optional equipment closer to its on-sale date this summer.

                <strong>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</strong>
                Like the Model 3, the 2020 Model Y will eventually be available in the cost-leader Standard Range
                trim,
                but the first variants to launch will be the Long Range and Performance models.
                Long Range models can be fitted with either rear- or all-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is standard on
                the
                Model Y Performance. We haven't driven the Model Y, but we welcomed a Model 3 sedan to our long-term
                fleet in late 2019 which has proven to be delightfully sporty to drive and quite quick thanks to the
                instantaneous power delivery of the electric motors.
                We expect the Model Y to offer similar driving dynamics and acceleration when it finally hits the
                market.</p>

            <h1><strong style="font-size: 40px; text-decoration: underline">Tesla Model X</strong></h1>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong>
                The 2020 Tesla Model X might be the greenestâ€”and one of the fastestâ€”way to tote up to seven people
                over
                hill and dale.
                As the crossover cousin to the brand's iconic Model S sedan, the X is actually practical, with
                all-wheel
                drive, a high-tech cabin with room for up to seven, and striking but fussy Falcon Wing doors. Two
                models
                are offered, both with over 300 miles of driving range, and each one is impressively quick thanks to
                two
                onboard electric motors; the Model X also handles quite nicely for such a heavy SUV, thanks in part
                to
                the fact that its batteries are mounted in the floor, creating a low center of gravity.
                The cabin is snazzy and rich with technology, but those expecting outright luxury will be
                disappointed.
            </p>

            </strong>
            Long Range: $81,190
            Performance: $101,190
            The Performance model with Ludicrous mode would surely be the most fun, but it's mighty expensive and
            its
            305-mile estimated driving range isn't as long as the less expensive Long Range model, so we'd save the
            $20,000. The Long Range model offers 20 more miles of estimated driving range and still feels mighty
            quick
            thanks to the immediacy of the electric motors' power delivery.

            <strong> Engine, Transmission, and Performance</strong>
            All Model Xs come standard with two electric motorsâ€”one at the front axle and one at the rearâ€”which
            enables
            them with all-wheel-drive capability. The standard Long Range model is quick and Tesla claims a
            zero-to-60-mph time of 4.4 seconds. A high-performance variant is also offered which comes with a
            305-mile
            range and a claimed zero-to-60-mph time of 2.7 seconds when its Ludicrous Mode is engaged. Handling is
            respectable, but the Model X's party trick is really the strong acceleration generated by its electric
            motors.</p>

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px; text-decoration: underline">Tesla Model S</h1>
            </strong>
            <p>
                <strong>Overview</strong>
                Elon Musk might say some crazy stuff, but he's right about at least one thing: his electric vehicles
                have changed the world. When the Model S launched in 2012, it was the first long-range, widely
                desired
                electric vehicle, and mainstream automakers have been struggling to catch up ever since. The Model S
                is
                still impressiveâ€”it now has an EPA-estimated 373 miles of range in its Long Range variantâ€”but for
                all
                its focus on autonomous technology, over-the-air updates, and Easter eggs, Tesla's interiors and
                build
                quality can sometimes fall short of expectations.
                Better-established luxury automakers are finally getting in on the EV gameâ€”Porsche's Taycan is aimed
                directly at the Model S, for exampleâ€”and Tesla will need all its Silicon Valley pivot-power to stay
                ahead of the pack.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pricing and Which One to Buy</strong>
                Long Range: $76,190
                Performance: $96,190
                We'd choose the Performance model because Ludicrous mode's effortless and insane sub-3.0-second
                zero-to-60-mph time is half the fun of owning a Tesla.
                <strong>
                    Engine, Transmission, and Performance
                </strong>
                With an electric motor dedicated to each of the front and rear axles, the Model S offers full-time
                all-wheel drive no matter which version you choose. Acceleration performance of the various models
                ranges from outstanding to ferocious.
                We haven't tested the 2020 Model S yet, but our 2018 100D test vehicle blasted from zero to 60 mph
                in a
                mere 3.9 seconds and delivered endless entertainment thanks to its immediate power delivery. If
                that's
                not enough for you, the Model S Performance will be far more brutal and can be had with the
                Ludicrous
                driving mode that sends the Model S from zero to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, according to Tesla. The
                Model S
                is an agile sports sedan with well-controlled body motions and direct steering. Two different
                settings
                allow drivers to choose heavy or light steering effort, but neither of them enable more feedback
                from
                the road ahead.
                Ride comfort is good, and the Model S imparts a solid feeling on the road that perfectly accompanies
                its
                tranquility when cruising.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Range, Charging, and Battery Life</strong>
                Under the Tesla's floor lies a battery pack that yields a low center of gravity and evenly
                distributed
                weight from front to rear. Driving range and acceleration performance varies from model to model,
                with
                the Long Range version's battery providing up to a 373-mile range while the Performance model offers
                up
                to 348.

                <strong>
                    Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG
                </strong>
                While rivals such as the Chevy Bolt EV and even Tesla's own Model 3 have encroached on its
                driving-range
                superiority, the Model S remains an impressive alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles when it
                comes to
                long-distance usability. The Model S Performance sacrifices some of its driving range to provide
                brutal
                acceleration performance. We tested a 100D model in 2018â€”which is essentially the Long Range Model S
                2019â€”and found that our real-world range differed significantly from Tesla's stated maximum range;
                our
                test vehicle's battery maxed out at 270 miles on our highway fuel-economy test route. If you drive
                more
                in the city, you should expect to get much closer to Tesla's claimed range.

                <strong>
                    Interior, Comfort, and Cargo
                </strong>
                With Model S prices starting at close to $80,000, buyers would be reasonable to expect a certain
                amount
                of luxury inside the car. The cabin's atmosphere is nice enough, but it's not nearly as plush as
                those
                of our favorites such as the Mercedes-Benz E-class and the Volvo S90. A few missteps, such as poorly
                aligned interior panels, remind us that Tesla is still working through some growing pains as a new
                carmaker. The Model S's sloped roofline cleverly hides a rear liftgate that opens up to reveal a
                huge
                26-cubic-foot trunk. We managed to stash eight of our carry-on-size cases without folding down the
                rear
                seats. Paltry small-item cubby stowage throughout the interiorâ€”especially in the back seatâ€”is offset
                by
                a large underfloor bin in the rear cargo area.

                <strong>
                    Infotainment and Connectivity
                </strong>
                Fans of modern minimalism will adore the Model S's cabin, which comes standard with a giant
                infotainment
                screen that controls almost all of the vehicle's functions. Technophiles will be in heaven, but
                we're
                not completely sold. The screen's positioning on the dashboard will require some drivers to lean
                forward
                in their seat to reach certain icons, especially those near the top right of the display.

                <strong>Overview</strong>
                The original Tesla Roadster put the all-electric automaker on the map, even if most Model S and
                Model X
                buyers don't remember it. Slated to make its return in 2021, the second-generation Roadster bests it
                predecessor by adding two small rear seats, significantly more driving range, and a much higher
                level of
                performance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasted about a 1.9-second 60-mph time and a 250-mph top speed when
                the
                Roadster concept was unveiled back in 2017â€”figures we very much hope will prove accurate when this
                sports car finally arrives.

                Tesla claims it will offer the base Roadster for $200,000 and a limited-edition Founders Series for
                $50,000
                more. We have no details on what differentiates the two, other than the fact that only 1000 Founders
                Series
                models will be built. If you're a collector, perhaps it's worth the extra dough. We'll update this
                story
                with more information about the car's standard an optional features when those details become
                available.

                <storng>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</stonrng>
                    When the 2021 Tesla Roadster was unveiled as a concept in November 2017, Musk touted some
                    pie-in-the-sky
                    performance numbers for this car, including a 60-mph time of 1.9 seconds, a top speed of more
                    than
                    250 mph,
                    and a quarter-mile time of just 8.8 seconds. That's outrageous. For reference, if that 60-mph
                    time
                    holds up,
                    it will mean the Roadster is a full second quicker than its key rival, the gasoline-powered
                    McLaren
                    570S.
                    Also during this conference, Musk noted that the Roadster will come with standard all-wheel
                    drive.
                    This is
                    less surprising. Tesla's mainstream EV models utilize two electric motorsâ€”one at the front and
                    one
                    at the
                    rearâ€”to drive all four wheels, so it makes sense we'd see the same setup for the Roadster.

                    Range, Charging, and Battery Life
                </strong>
                The 200-kWh battery is said to provide up to 620 miles of range, but certainly that number will be
                achievable only under very light use; hitting the track for some flat-out hot laps will cut that
                estimate considerably.
                <strong>
                    Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG
                </strong>
                The EPA hasn't released its ratings for the Roadster's fuel economy, but those details are sure to
                emerge closer to the car's on-sale date. We hope to have a chance to test the new Roadster. If/when
                we
                do, we'll put it through our 200-mile highway fuel-economy test and report its results here.
                <strong>
                    Interior, Comfort, and Cargo

                </strong>
                For now, the 2021 Roadster is merely a concept, and in general, concepts change drastically during
                their
                development into production models. As shown, the Roadster concept features a removable glass-panel
                roof, which you can stow in the trunk. It has four seats, but the rear ones look as though they may
                not
                fit adults, given the Roadster's dramatically angled roofline. Other than that, we expect to see
                Tesla's
                signature minimalist interior design repeated here.
